\# Integrator Progress Log



The integrator is implemented as the loop filter in the first-order sigma-delta ADC. Its main function is to accumulate the error signal between the analog input and the 1-bit DAC feedback output. This accumulated error is then sent to the comparator, which generates the 1-bit digital bitstream for the sigma-delta modulator.



In a first-order sigma-delta ADC, the integrator is the key block that shapes the quantization noise. By integrating the input error over time, the circuit pushes a significant portion of the quantization noise toward higher frequencies. The high-frequency noise can then be attenuated by the digital decimation filter, allowing the ADC to achieve higher effective resolution than a conventional 1-bit quantizer.



The integrator is implemented using a fully differential switched-capacitor topology. The switched-capacitor network samples the input and feedback signals using non-overlapping clock phases, while the fully differential amplifier provides the required gain and settling performance.

\## Schematic Design

The integrator consists of a switched-capacitor input network, feedback capacitors, non-overlapping clock phases, and a fully differential amplifier. During the sampling phase, the input and DAC feedback voltages are sampled onto the capacitors. During the integration phase, the stored charge is transferred to the feedback capacitor, producing an output voltage proportional to the accumulated error.



The fully differential amplifier is used to maintain differential signal operation, improve common-mode noise rejection, and provide sufficient gain for accurate charge transfer. The output of the integrator is connected to the comparator input, while the comparator output controls the 1-bit DAC feedback path.



\## Integrator Operation



<div align="center">



| \*\*Clock Phase\*\* | \*\*Operation\*\* | \*\*Description\*\* |

|----------------|---------------|-----------------|

| Φ1 | Sampling Phase | Input and DAC feedback signals are sampled onto the sampling capacitors |

| Φ2 | Integration Phase | Stored charge is transferred to the feedback capacitors through the OTA |

| Non-overlap time | Clock Isolation | Prevents direct charge sharing or short-circuit paths between phases |



</div>



The discrete-time integrator behavior can be approximated as:



<div align="center">



V<sub>out</sub>\[n] = V<sub>out</sub>\[n-1] + (C<sub>s</sub>/C<sub>f</sub>) × V<sub>error</sub>\[n]



</div>



where C<sub>s</sub> is the sampling capacitor, C<sub>f</sub> is the feedback capacitor, and V<sub>error</sub> is the difference between the input signal and the DAC feedback signal. When C<sub>s</sub> = C<sub>f</sub>, the integrator coefficient is approximately 1.



\## Design Considerations



<div align="center">



| \*\*Design Aspect\*\* | \*\*Consideration\*\* |

|------------------|-------------------|

| Capacitor Ratio | Determines the integrator coefficient C<sub>s</sub>/C<sub>f</sub> |

| OTA DC Gain | Affects integration accuracy and finite-gain error |

| OTA Settling | Must settle within the available clock phase |

| Clock Non-Overlap | Required to avoid charge sharing and short-circuit paths |

| kT/C Noise | Sampling capacitors must be large enough to limit thermal noise |

| Charge Injection | Switch sizing and clocking affect sampling accuracy |

| Clock Feedthrough | Can introduce error into the sampled signal |

| Output Swing | Must remain within the linear range of the OTA |

| Common-Mode Stability | Fully differential operation requires common-mode control |

| Power Consumption | Must fit within the ADC power budget |

\## OTA Requirement for Integrator



The integrator performance strongly depends on the fully differential amplifier. The OTA must provide enough gain, speed, and output swing to ensure accurate charge transfer during the integration phase.



<div align="center">



| \*\*OTA Parameter\*\* | \*\*Target\*\* | \*\*Unit\*\* |

|------------------|-----------:|----------|

| DC Gain | >60 | dB |

| Unity-Gain Frequency | >400 | MHz |

| Phase Margin | >55 | degree |

| Output Common-Mode | 1.65 | V |

| Power Consumption | Part of <3 mW ADC budget | - |

| Input Pair gm | \~1.6 | mS |

| Load Capacitance | 0.5 | pF |



</div>



The settling requirement is estimated from the target ADC resolution. For a target SNDR above 65 dB, the equivalent resolution is approximately 10.5 bits, so the integrator settling error should be significantly smaller than one LSB-equivalent error. This makes OTA settling one of the most important design constraints for the switched-capacitor integrator.



\## Simulation



The integrator should be verified using transient simulation with proper non-overlapping clocks. The input signal can be tested using DC, sine wave, square wave, and differential step inputs. The expected behavior is that the integrator output accumulates the input error over time and remains stable within the allowed output swing.



Recommended simulations include:

\## Notes



The integrator is the central analog block of the first-order sigma-delta ADC. Its accuracy depends on capacitor matching, OTA gain, OTA settling, switch behavior, clock timing, and common-mode control. Even though the comparator and DAC form the quantizer and feedback path, the integrator determines how the quantization error is accumulated and shaped before being converted into the 1-bit output stream.



For early simulations, the OTA and switched-capacitor network can be tested separately before being connected to the full sigma-delta loop. After individual block verification, the integrator should be simulated together with the comparator and 1-bit DAC to confirm stable modulator operation.
