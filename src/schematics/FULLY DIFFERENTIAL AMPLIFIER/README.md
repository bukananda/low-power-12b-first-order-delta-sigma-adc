\# Fully Differential Amplifier Progress Log



The fully differential amplifier is implemented as the main analog gain block used in the switched-capacitor integrator of the first-order sigma-delta ADC. Its function is to amplify the differential input signal while rejecting common-mode noise and maintaining a stable output common-mode level. In the sigma-delta modulator, this amplifier is critical because the integrator accuracy, settling behavior, noise performance, and linearity strongly depend on the OTA performance.



The amplifier is designed using a fully differential topology to improve noise immunity, common-mode rejection, and signal swing. Since the ADC uses a switched-capacitor integrator, the amplifier must provide sufficient DC gain, unity-gain frequency, phase margin, and slew rate so that the output can settle within the available clock phase. The sizing process is initially performed using the gm/ID methodology and then verified through ngspice simulations in Xschem.

\## Schematic Design

<h4 align="center" style="font-size:16px;">Figure 1. Fully Differential Amplifier Schematic</h4>



The amplifier is designed as a fully differential analog block with differential inputs V<sub>p</sub> and V<sub>m</sub>, and differential outputs V<sub>op</sub> and V<sub>om</sub>. The circuit is biased using V<sub>biasn</sub> and V<sub>biasp</sub> to set the operating currents of the NMOS and PMOS branches.



The topology is intended to provide high gain while maintaining sufficient speed for switched-capacitor operation. The amplifier output is used by the sigma-delta integrator, so the output must settle accurately before the next comparator decision and DAC feedback phase.



\## Design Considerations



<div align="center">



| \*\*Design Aspect\*\* | \*\*Consideration\*\* |

|------------------|-------------------|

| DC Gain | Must be high enough to reduce integrator error |

| Unity-Gain Frequency | Must support fast switched-capacitor settling |

| Phase Margin | Required for stable closed-loop operation |

| Slew Rate | Must support large signal transitions within the clock phase |

| Output Common-Mode | Should remain close to 1.65 V |

| Input Common-Mode Range | Must support integrator and sampling network levels |

| Noise | Thermal noise and flicker noise must be considered |

| Power Consumption | Must fit within the ADC power budget |

| Device Matching | Important for differential symmetry and offset reduction |

| Saturation Margin | All analog MOSFETs should remain in saturation |

\## gm/ID-Based Initial Sizing



The initial sizing is performed using the gm/ID methodology with GF180MCU 3.3 V transistor lookup tables. The target transconductance is derived from the settling requirement of the switched-capacitor integrator.



For the initial design, the input pair is targeted around moderate inversion to balance power efficiency and speed. Cascode, current source, and load devices are sized with longer channel lengths to improve output resistance and DC gain.

The sizing values above assume that the Xschem MOS symbol uses `w` as the width per finger and `nf` as the number of fingers. Therefore, the effective total width is approximately:



<div align="center">



W<sub>total</sub> = W<sub>finger</sub> × nf

\## Simulation



The fully differential amplifier is simulated using Xschem and ngspice. The simulations are performed on the amplifier symbol in a separate testbench schematic. The testbench includes DC bias sources, differential input sources, output load capacitors, and common-mode control for initial verification.



Recommended simulations include:

The output differential voltage is approximately zero under balanced DC input conditions, which is expected for a symmetrical fully differential amplifier. The current sign in ngspice depends on the voltage source current convention; therefore, the power is calculated as:

\## Notes



The fully differential amplifier is one of the most important analog blocks in the sigma-delta ADC because it directly determines the accuracy and speed of the switched-capacitor integrator. The initial gm/ID sizing provides a reasonable starting point, but the design must be iterated using operating point, AC, transient, and noise simulations.



For early simulations, an ideal common-mode feedback helper may be used to stabilize the output common-mode. However, the final fully differential amplifier should include a proper CMFB circuit or clearly document the common-mode control strategy.
